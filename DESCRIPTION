Description: PAST takes GWAS output and assigns SNPs to genes, uses those genes
  to find pathways associated with the genes, and plots pathways based on
  significance. Implements methods for reading GWAS input data, finding genes
  associated with SNPs, calculating enrichment score and significance of pathways,
  and plotting pathways.
