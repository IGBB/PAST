Description: PAST takes GWAS output and assigns SNPs to genes, uses those genes
    to find pathways associated with the genes, and plots pathways based on
    significance. Implements methods for reading GWAS input data, finding genes
    associated with SNPs, calculating enrichment score and significance of 
    pathways, and plotting pathways.
